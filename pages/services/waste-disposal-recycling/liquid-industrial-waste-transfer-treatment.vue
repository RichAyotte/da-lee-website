	<p>Collection, transportation, and disposal of all types of liquid industrial
	waste, ranging from oily water, industrial wastewater and emulsions. Da-Lee
	reclaims oil from wastewater and recycles this oil for use in re-refining and
	fuel blending.</p>

	<p>Treatable waste water is stored in our tank farm and blended for water
	treatment. All un-treatable waste water is transported to other facilities in
	Canada and the U.S.A. Da-Lee operates vacuum trucks and liquid tankers and
	straight trucks to collect the waste from your site and safely transport to our
	licensed facility.</p>

	<ul>
	<li>MOE licensed customers can also transport liquid industrial waste to our
	facility for treatment</li>
	<li>Our facility in Stoney Creek, Ontario is open Monday-Friday from 7:00am
	to 7:00pm. We can be open on weekends and at night if prior arrangements are
	made with our operations staff</li>
